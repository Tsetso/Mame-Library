Mame-Library (hack)
===================

This project is a hack of awesome [Random Sequence's Mame Library](http://www.randomsequence.com/software/mame-library/), a gorgeus iTunes like MAME front-end for Mac OSX.

The hack presents the following enhacenments:

* Now runs **only with SDL Mame**, it no longer uses Mame OSX (the project died on v135)
* ROMS can be stored on paths with blanks on its name.
* Double clink now works when you select the first rom of the list (or the filtered list)
* Now you can launch no audit games

New MAME parameters:

* Switch resolutions if fullscreen is selected
* Preescale factor
* Can run on multithread mode
* New smartlist for 2k's games
